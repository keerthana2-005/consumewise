# ConsumeWise: AI-Driven Health Analysis

Utilizing AI to generate a comprehensive health analysis for packaged products. This analysis can be tailored to the general public or customized based on individual user needs, providing relevant nudges for healthier decisions. The core areas covered in the analysis include:

### 1. Nutritional Analysis:
- **High Presence of Unwanted Nutrients**: 
   - Evaluates levels of fats, sugar, sodium, and calories that are ideally consumed in lower quantities.
   - Flags products with excessive amounts of these nutrients as potential risks to health.

### 2. Processing & Nutrient Deficiency:
- **Degree of Processing**: 
   - Assesses how processed the product is and its impact on nutrient retention.
   - Flags nutrient-deficient products or those heavily reliant on artificial additives.
  
### 3. Harmful Ingredients:
- **Identification of Harmful Substances**: 
   - Scans for harmful or controversial ingredients such as trans fats, artificial preservatives, high levels of fructose corn syrup, etc.
   - Provides a breakdown of ingredients that could have long-term health consequences.

### 4. Diet Compliance:
- **Compatibility with Popular Diets**:
   - Cross-checks product ingredients against common dietary plans (e.g., keto, vegan, low-carb).
   - Highlights whether the product is suitable for people following specific diets.

### 5. Diabetes & Allergen Friendliness:
- **Special Dietary Considerations**:
   - Identifies if the product is safe for individuals with diabetes by analyzing sugar and carb content.
   - Flags potential allergens such as gluten, peanuts, dairy, etc., for users with food allergies.

### 6. Brand Claims Verification:
- **Validation of Product Claims**:
   - Compares the brand's health claims against factual data.
   - Highlights if any claims made on the packaging (e.g., "low fat," "organic") could be misleading based on the actual product content.
